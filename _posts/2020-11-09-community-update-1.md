## Overview

If you are active on our [<u>discord</u>](http://discord.gg/u64Mg4X), you should be familiar with the regular updates I post there every Monday.

However, I realize that not everyone has the time to go to discord, and trying to fit everything there is not always easy, so starting this week, you'll see the weekly updates on this website.

As this is the first one, I've decided to write a recap of the latest news for everyone here.

- [<u>Coverage update</u>](#coverage-update)
- [<u>Discord update</u>](#discord-update)

## changes

### Coverage Update

I stumbled upon two incredible youtubers: <u>Ed</u> and <u>Bloba</u>.

Every week, Ed will cover news on the game, and other similar monster-taming games. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have a community if I hadn't found out about him, so he's obviously making it into the game.

<br/>

Bloba is a patreon and has made a couple of videos on the game. He has helped run most of the naming contests and has won a ton of inti(shiny) art contests. Here is a video of him going over the first Q&A:

### Discord Update

Ah, I have no idea how it has worked until now, but the community is pretty weird and wholesome. Just like in my dreams!

For names of the creatures, we had plenty of naming contests that ended with [<u>a document</u>](/assets/naming_results0.pdf) written by one of our community members (Marlon).

For shinies, an artist took over (Bisloba) and is running the contests very smoothly. Every other day I get to see some really interesting entries, and people with little artistic experience get to participate too!

<i>ps: Contests would lose a substancial part of their charm without BaguetteBug's puns</i>

And there have even been a couple of memes about it. I hope you like them too!

We've also had TbH (trials by hamster) to decide a couple of those contest when they ended in a tie. A community member(Sirc) coordinated with his hamster(Samira) to help us. Here is the first one of those:

<br/>

There is a scene in an anime I really like where a character tells the other everything they have to offer to them. The list is as follows:

- being able to help [him] study
- a cute junior classmate
- a brusque father
- a starry sky
- spiteful and abusive words

{% include youtube_video.html youtube_id = "15ljA_zM0ME" %}
<br/>
I wonder what I'll be able to offer to my players at the end of this journey. But today, that list surely includes memes, pictures of cute pets and food, as it should!
