*ps: You can find them for fanart and other purposes [here, on a public Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QlBXcp89XKwfYqI4F9qCJDItt7CFJeyg)*

As a last-minute surprise, I revealed concept art for some otters that are also part of batch #3:

## Community Update

### Wiki

The dex was moved, to the game's official [Wiki](https://wiki.necromancers-gift.com), which includes the following pages:

- An updated [necrodex](https://wiki.necromancers-gift.com/dex)
<div class="image-container">
  <img src="/assets/images/updates/18/wiki-dex.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""/>
</div>

- A list of [all moves](https://wiki.necromancers-gift.com/moves)
- A list of [all items](https://wiki.necromancers-gift.com/items)
<div class="image-container">
  <img src="/assets/images/updates/18/wiki-items.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/>
</div>

### Issue Tracker

The game's issue tracker, along with the private codebase for the game, was moved to [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/necromancers-gift1/necromancers-gift) (so that you can truly track what I am working on).
It includes:

- [all issues and feature requests](https://gitlab.com/necromancers-gift1/necromancers-gift/-/issues)
- [a board that groups them into categories](https://gitlab.com/necromancers-gift1/necromancers-gift/-/boards/3703571)
<div class="image-container">
  <img src="/assets/images/updates/18/gitlab-roadmap.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/>
</div>

- all future [milestones](https://gitlab.com/necromancers-gift1/necromancers-gift/-/milestones) for the game
- a dedicated email address to file issues (so that you don't need any cumbersome login), which I'll provide to those that have access to the alpha as soon as possible

### Hosting

Necrobot's discord integration was moved to a server hosted by [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud).

I still love google cloud's free tier, but you can't really beat what they offer for $5 a month.

## Game Update

- internal version `0.4.8-playtest-alpha1` changelog:

```
= features:
= ===========
- add wiki
  - add list of all available moves
  - add list of all available items
  - show necrodex there
  - add moveset for each creature on the necrodex
  - sort necrodex by id by default
  - improve dex look by using crests
- Add held items batch #1 (you can see their effects in the wiki. around 50 items were added)
    drum,snail_insignia,pirate_bandana,lock,sand_clock_empty,sand_clock_start,sand_clock_end,
    sword,sword_flame,sword_ice,sword_purple,staff,staff_branch,hammer,hammer_flame,hammer_ice,hammer_purple,
    pirate_hat,wizard_hat2,book_red,book_green,book_blue,book_healing,book_death,cauldron,cauldron_full,cape,
    cape_red,cape_green,cape_blue,cape_purple,bell,trumpet,rose,rose_bouquet,scarf,scarf_red,scarf_blue,
    mittens,mittens_red,mittens_blue,book_red_flipped,book_red_open,book_green_flipped,book_green_open,
    book_blue_flipped,book_blue_open,mortar
- add moveset info
  - in dev mode, detect duplicates, non-existing moves and check movesets are ordered
- add endlessShift ability (rotate your battle after each turn. useful for future special events)
- make minimal changes for conducting a battle and taking screenshots (for discord bot, etc)

= fixes:
= ===========
- fix how tweet and chirp work (to be later renamed. probably)
- fix tweet action's condition
    (it previously always triggered, hence tortui being.. basically suicidal. So that is fixed)
- [battle] add better (but incomplete) move labels
- [battle] change how targets are shown in battle
    (from weird unicode to either per-move labels, or just the full target, for status effects, for example)
- [battle] show level, move priority indicator to leftmost position
- make first floor level difference bigger
- other fixes that I can't recall right now
```

- the next update, `0.5.0 (the moveset update)`, is almost complete.
  Most of it involved adding movesets for each creature in the game. All that is missing is a way for a player to pick moves as creatures level up, and other tiny fixes which you can see in [the public issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/necromancers-gift1/necromancers-gift/-/milestones/4#tab-issues).
- You can also see the details for the update after that, `0.6.0 (the shop update)`, in the public issue tracker [too](https://gitlab.com/necromancers-gift1/necromancers-gift/-/milestones/5#tab-issues). The gist of it is that most items that I added are still unobtainable since they cannot be bought, so there is work to be done in how currency (necrocoins) are acquired and spent.
