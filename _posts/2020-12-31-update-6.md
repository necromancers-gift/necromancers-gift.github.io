## Art Update

Last week I showed the fire legendary animation. This week, you can see the water and wind legendary lines in fluid animations below.

## Community Update

The water and fire legendary naming polls ended in a triple-way tie each. So look forward to even more voting next year!

On the other hand, we have names for the wind legendary line:

```
Buresuaki > Kazeaki
```

I personally really like the names the community picked. And since we are talking about names, if you had trouble memorizing the creature names, there is now a daily trivia game that you can play on [<u>discord</u>](https://discord.gg/u64Mg4X):

And finally, since a lot of people requested it, I've added a leaderboard. Can you make it to the top 10?

## Gameplay Update

version `v0.3.5-prototype.0` of the prototype is out with a bunch of tiny fixes.
Here's the changelog for it:

- features

  - [battle] show creature names
  - [trial] add creature name, affinity, stats and starting held item to starting screen
  - [trial] generating trials with specific starting held items is now possible

- fixes:

  - [battle] show item button on smaller screens
  - [battle] add numpad 1 and 2 keys support to switch party members out
  - [battle] fix potions healing a creature if it dies in the same turn
  - [battle] change bite damage
  - [battle] add scuffle move (struggle) when out of usable moves (when your MP runs out)
  - [battle] fix picking items in item menu for battles
  - [map] fix selecting routes with a mouse
  - [map] highlight only pickable choices
  - [settings] fix volume
  - [settings] add option to skip the story, tutorials
  - [settings] remember settings after closing the app, losing, etc

If you are only interested in the features, I think the new starter screen provides much more information than the old one. You can see it in action here:

And don't worry, this week was mostly about tiny but necessary fixes, but I see a bright future ahead of the game!

ps: Happy new year. Thanks to all our community members, testers, and helpers for making this game possible.

I am very hopeful that 2021 will be a great year, after all the ugliness that 2020 gave us.
