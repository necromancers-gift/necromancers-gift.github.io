- [<u>Community Update</u>](#community-update)
- [<u>Game Update</u>](#game-update)

## Community Update

Earlier in 2022, the game reached 1k wishlists on Steam. Go wishlist it [now](http://steam.pm/app/1409650)!

I was also able to uphold my end of the promise and spent very little time on Necrobot (the Discord integration for the game). Despite that, significant QoL features and fixes made it into the bot (talk about efficiency):

- extra boxes for storage
- updated dex with creatures from batch 3 and milestones

</div>

- ability to reroll auctions and preview what creatures would be coming next

## Game Update

The game received weekly updates this January, on the _unstable_ branch on Steam. Here are the highlights:

- revamped shop menu along with full controller and keyboard-only support to buy items

</div>

- revamped seed picker, with a background that changes as the seed changes, along with concept art that is blurred as sort of a preview of creatures to see in the game

If you want more details, it is all in the [bug tracker](https://gitlab.com/necromancers-gift1/necromancers-gift/-/issues?scope=all&state=closed), which just as I desired is absolutely keeping track of everything. As a more general overview, here's the changelog for those updates:

- <pre style="color: orange">version 0.5.0-playtest-alpha1</pre>

```asciidoc
features
==========

- change how moves are stored
  - fixes long-standing issue where teaching a move bought from the shop would mess up the moveset information of a creature
  - allows picking old moves eventually and naturally selecting new moves as a creature levels up

- improve level up event (and let a player pick new moves)
  - show levels gained for each creature in the player's team in a clearer way than before
  - show moves learnt on level up
  - show a move picker if the creatures have too many active moves to pick new ones
  - use a more refined UI for all of this, with subtle animations and a more fitting font
```

- <pre style="color: orange">version 0.5.3-playtest-alpha1</pre>

```asciidoc
features
==========

- added more concept art as backgrounds used in main screens (shown when selecting a seed, and in the shop)
- update dialog look & feel
- update shop look & feel

fixes
==========

- disallow buying items with negative cost (this increased the player's coin balance too)
- fix issue where a player couldn't buy or sell anything from the shop using a controller / keyboard
```

- <pre style="color: orange">version 0.5.4-playtest-alpha1</pre>

```asciidoc
features
==========

- added full controller support (scrolling windows, virtual keyboard for input)
```

- <pre style="color: orange">version 0.5.5-playtest-alpha1</pre>

```asciidoc
features
==========

- minimized save state size (from around ~50KB to around ~1KB when compressed) for a typical run
  (this is before proper optimization which may not even really happen)

- added ability to send anonymous data to help in the development of the game.
  - nothing, and I mean NOTHING even remotely personal is kept (not even screen sizes, operating system, etc)
    best way to comply with GDPR is to just simply not collect any personal data or pseudo personal data at all
```
