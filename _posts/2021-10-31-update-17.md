## Art Update

Since the first two batches of creatures have been revealed, I thought this was a good time to show concept art for each batch.

Here's the concept art for batch #1:

</div>

And most of the creatures from batch #2:

</div>

Speaking of batches, some creatures from batch #3 have been revealed too:

<div class="image-container">
  <img src="/assets/images/creatures/dino_anim_final.gif" loading="lazy" alt="" style="width:33%;"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/creatures/fluffy_anim_final.gif" loading="lazy" alt="" style="width:33%;"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/creatures/alien_anim_final.gif" loading="lazy" alt="" style="width:33%;"/>
</div>

## Community Update

Before revealing creatures from batch #3, I posted only their shadows and ran a poll to determine which ones would be revealed first.

</div>

And as you can see in the [art update](#art-update) section, the dark dinosaur-looking creatures were revealed first, and they even got named already:

> Viltooth > Orthrend

Don't forget that you can suggest [names on discord](http://discord.gg/u64Mg4X). A poll every week is used to pick the names, so make sure to vote on those too.

And because I know how important it is to see all creatures in one place, [the bestiary](/bestiary) was updated and will be updated as more creatures from batch #3 are revealed.

On Halloween itself, there was a small contest to reveal the next creature early, which you can see below. ðŸŽƒ Happy belated Halloween ðŸŽƒ

## Game Update

- On the first update of the month, I focused on cleaning up and adding more moves. Specifically, stat-focused moves. I can also confirm that these moves will be in latin, so they are easier to identify, as well as to tie it to the Necromancer's love for what we would call dead languages. I also added a bunch of tests to make sure these moves were working correctly. You can see some of those in the image below.

- On the second update of the month, I focused on adding the ability to name your creatures after defeating a floor leader. This is in my eyes one of the most important remaining features that was left to be added to the game.
