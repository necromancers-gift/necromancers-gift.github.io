## Overview

- [<u>Kickstarter update</u>](#kickstarter-update)
- [<u>Art update</u>](#art-update)
- [<u>Community update</u>](#community-update)

## Kickstarter Update

I'm pleased to say that the [<u>Kickstarter</u>](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/necromancers-gift/necromancers-gift) succesfully launched last week, on March 9th to be more precise. Believe it or not, in under 24 hours, it reached its goal!

The game even got international coverage in a [<u>Chinese forum</u>](https://keylol.com/t694916-1-1) and a [<u>Spanish indie-focused website</u>](https://www.behindgaming.com/necromancers-gift-juego-domar-criaturas-adultos/).

As of this post, it has also reached 2 of its stretch goals:

## Art Update

- A new creature line has been revealed. They look like wolves to me:

## Community Update

- Name Contests have resumed. This marks the beginning of the second batch of names for the game. I expect a third batch after the Kickstarter, with the last set of creatures that will be added to the game.

The names for the creatures above are _Thunbos and Fulgurus_ respectively, and they are the only confirmed names we have so far.

There are also two ongoing polls, including the second round for the jellyfish line I revealed a couple of weeks ago:

</div>

As usual, make sure to join [<u>the discord</u>](http://discord.gg/u64Mg4X) to vote for your favorite names, and to suggest names for the wolves.

## Riddle

If you are looking for the second word in the riddle, here it is:
`taco`.

The next hint will appear on twitter before the end of the Kickstarter. Since this is the first riddle, it'll be very straightforward.
