Speaking of Sirc, the 3 missing TbH (trial by hamster) were conducted to pick some of the secondary shinies for the second batch (Quilla forms). Thanks Sirc and Samira for helping out!

Famous last words, am I right?

I thought about writing a long apology here but I think it's relatively easy to see that I didn't really follow through. That's on me.
All that I can say now is that I am sorry, and I will pick up the pace again and keep at it.

If you have opted-in for the alpha, and still haven't received a key, make sure to e-mail [<u>support@pensivelion.com</u>](support@pensivelion.com)

Thanks for reading this, sorry again, and I hope to see you next month, with bigger news, hopefully!
