## Art Update

Earlier this week I shared a GIF with the idle animations of all known creatures.
Maybe someday we will have a rap contest for it? Who knows.

I can also confirm that this game will have legendaries, one for each primary affinity. Each legendary can evolve too!

## Music Update

Remember that missing song that I was speaking about? Oliver was kind enough to send me the final version a couple of days ago. I hope you like it!

## Community Update

Shiny contests are virtually over, and legendary naming contests are next.

Each affinity will be able to pick a name for their respective legendary. As an interesting fact, I let members change their affinity but curiously enough, virtually nobody did. This is only the beginning of affinity-based content, so make sure to join the [<u>discord</u>](http://discord.gg/u64Mg4X) to participate.

As a bonus, [<u>@Safira</u>](https://twitter.com/DC_Safira) did some excellent fanart for Magauri's evolutionary family:

## Online Architecture Update

This week I completed a major overhaul of online services for the game, which included moving the bot's database to its own instance and changing from `sqlite` to `postgreSQL`. my main goal is keeping fees low (the entire thing runs mostly on GCP's Free Tier and costs about $6/month) and to allow it to be scaled if the game is ever popular enough.

A picture is worth a thousand words:

As a bonus, I also prepared a sketch of deployments for the game. At some point in time, I was spending up to an hour preparing builds for testers. Now all of that is in the past and deployments are a breeze. Testers even get a quick notification when a version is uploaded. Talk about using computers to do the heavy lifting!
