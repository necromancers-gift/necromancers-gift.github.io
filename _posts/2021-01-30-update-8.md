I made an announcement a few weeks ago on discord. I had almost run out of funding and I genuinely thought the only path forward was to go at it part-time. On top of that, a relatively similar game had been just released on steam that is in my eyes insanely good and has a great dev as a bonus.

From devs in the monster taming community to regulars, and even established youtubers, I received insanely positive messages. Not only of encouragement, but respecting my decision.

You see, I had considered kickstarter. Meeting my funding goal (10k CAD) was simply not happening. As a small indie dev, that for all intends and purposes is going at it alone, while contracting people for the art and music, I simply do not have the following (on twitter) or a mailing list big enough to make that a reality. I ran the numbers again and again, contacting people with solid statistical backgrounds to give me at least false hope, but they also agreed with me.

And then I got an idea. Perhaps too late.

There is always a way. It's been a weird month to say the least. [<u>But I have a plan and I will go the kickstarter route seeking 5k CAD in funding.</u>](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/necromancers-gift/necromancers-gift?ref=clipboard-prelaunch)

More details on the Kickstarter are coming, but I will not compromise in making sure I underpromise and overdeliver.
I'll do it on my own terms, fully acknowledging my limitations and putting out there what I've done so far.

As a final note, I leave you with the first verses of a poem by Benedetti, one of my favourite writers:

> _¿Cómo hacerte saber que siempre hay tiempo?  
> Que uno sólo tiene que buscarlo y dárselo.  
> Que nadie establece normas salvo la vida._
