This week I mostly worked on making the in-game battle UI awesome.

The main takeaway from the reddit feedback post that I made was that it was not clear who was fighting who and there were too many elements in the UI.

I fixed that by facing each mon against one another and by removing XP bars, affinity badges, and visual elements that made it harder to read what was going on.

For reference, here are a couple of screenshots of how the battle UI has changed over time.
