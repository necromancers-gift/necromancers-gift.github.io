## Kickstarter Update

The [<u>Kickstarter Campaign</u>](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/necromancers-gift/necromancers-gift) succesfully ended on April 8th, reaching 523% of its goal. 15 days later, I received the payment from Kickstarter on my business account. Here's the breakdown, for those that are interested:

```
CA$ 26,134.29   Total raised

−CA$ 1,086.00   Dropped Pledges

−CA$ 1,252.41   Kickstarter Fee

−CA$   899.48   Payment processing fee
__

CA$ 22,896.40
CA$     59.97   Late Pledges through website
__

CA$ 22,956.37   Total Raised
```

Keep in mind that if you missed the Kickstarter, you don't have to worry. You can still be a late-backer. There is a sweet alpha-tier available on the site's store. [<u>Check it now!</u>](/store)

## Art Update

The second batch of creatures has almost been entirely revealed. As a recap, here they are again:

If you are wondering about those circles, the <span style="color:#209cee;">blue ones</span> encircle the creatures that are yet to be named, and the <span style="color:#e76e55">red ones</span> the creatures that will need to be redesigned a bit.

As a sneak peak into the future, you can see here some of the concept art for the third and perhaps last batch of creatures:

Finally, I wanted to congratulate the winners of the [<u>fanart contest</u>](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/necromancers-gift/necromancers-gift/posts/3157822). To the left, you'll find my pick, and to the right the community pick. I cannot believe people made so many entries and you should definitely look at [<u>the rest</u>](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/necromancers-gift/necromancers-gift/posts/3157822). Now. They are all winners in my heart because they all look so great!

## Community Update

As a result of the Kickstarter, and some marketing efforts on my side, the discord for the game now has over **590 members**, and on twitter, the game has over **800 followers**.

I think I won't write a full post on how taxing the Kickstarter campaign was, but I think it suffices to say that it took me a couple of days to go back to full-development mode. On that note, I have posted _office hours_ for my availability on discord. Unless I change them, they are as follows:

**Monday and Friday, 12PM-2PM EST**

On top of that, it is likely that you'll find me on discord around 12PM-2PM EST every other day, but you have no guarantees.
If you have a question that can wait a day, or two, you could always send an e-mail to **leo@pensivelion.com** instead.

_Necrobot concept art_

In terms of _necrobot_ updates, besides minor quality of life changes, and a way to verify Kickstarter backers, you aren't missing much:

- There is a new _#bot-events_ channel to make sure daily trivia is easier to find.
- On April 1st we held a sort of throw-a-pie competition. You can see a couple of those commands here:

PS: Very recently, I joined the Apple developer program to be able to release the game on iOS. That won't happen for a while, but it's nice setting things up now and not waiting last minute for these things.

## Game Update

In less exciting news, I decided to make backups on a different provider for the database. As you may know, the server infrastructure for the game is hosted on [<u>Google Cloud</u>](/2020/12/05/update-4.html#online-architecture-update), and I thought having backups on Amazon's AWS S3 made sense just in case something goes very wrong with my current setup. Having backups is always a good idea in my mind.

Finally, I got to finish up the implementation of teaching and overriding movesets for the creatures in your team. There is even a menu now to do it relatively quickly. Keep in mind that the UI is not final at all - _especially those buttons_. You can see a preview here:
