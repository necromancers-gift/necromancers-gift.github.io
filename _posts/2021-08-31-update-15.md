## Art Update

Concept art for one of the creatures from batch #3 has been revealed:

</div>

As a teaser, I also showed the shadows of most of the upcoming batch #3 creatures:

</div>

Shiny Contests for batch #2 ended, and I'll update this post shortly with the winners. Note that there are a couple of Trial By Hamster events that are going to dtermine which of the winners is the quilla form.

## Community Update

## Game Update

### Alpha News

The early alpha for the game is out on Steam, as a playtest. I'll be emailing keys soon to Kickstarter backers and supporters that preordered the game on this website.

However, if you want a game that you can play, **I strongly suggest that you wait.**

Despite what I had intended and said earlier, I'd also ask content creators to **wait a couple more weeks before streaming or showcasing the game.** No NDAs as usual, just a polite request.

Games sadly take a long time to make.

I wanted to stick with the original deadline for this part of the project for an incredibly simple reason: accountability.

</div>

And so I am making the current build of the game available to all the people that support the project.
I am 100% aware however that things are not only buggy but incomplete, and I've had to scramble to find ways to make a build that, well, at least doesn't crash upon opening.

I've also not been 100% capable of managing everything besides coding that makes part of being a game dev. I don't think this is particularly surprising, given my inexperience, but I still wanted to let you all know. This just means some slight delays, but there are no impossible to surmount obstacles right now. Just a ton of work.

Updates are coming, and with them, slowly but firmly, the game will be made.
