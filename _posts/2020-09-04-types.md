# Types in Necromancer's Gift

In this blog post we will cover

- [All Affinities](#affinities)
- [Affinity groups](#affinity-groups)
- [attack modifiers (SAM and SAD)](#attack-modifiers)

## Affinities

The 6 affinities in this game are the following:

- water
- fire
- wind
- electric
- ice
- earth

## Affinity Groups

- There are two groups (as shown below)
  - water, fire, wind
  - electric, ice, earth

- Shadow creatures can have 1 or 2 affinities, each from a different group

  - _This means that certain combinations are not possible, like fire/water, earth/electric, etc_

- Groups work like rock-paper-scissors

  - _water is strong against fire, fire against wind and wind against water, etc_

- An opposite affinity is an affinity in the same group that is strong against the affinity you've picked
  - _Example: fire is the opposite affinity of water_

## Attack Modifiers

When it comes to affinities, there are two multipliers to be aware of:

- **SAM (same affinity multiplier)**
  - if you attack with a creature that has the same type as the move you are performing, you receive a **1.5X multiplier**
- **SAD(same affinity divider)**

  - if you attack with a creature that has a type that is opposite to the move you are performing, you receive a **0.75X multiplier**

- For example, If you are attacking with a creature with water affinity with a fire attack, this attack does 0.75 times as much damage as it would do normally\_
- _On the other hand, if a wind creatures attacks with an electric attack, no modifier is applied_
