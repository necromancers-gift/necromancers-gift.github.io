In this blog post we will cover affinities in the game.

> Tip: For all intends and purposes, _affinities_ are just a game-specific term for _types_ in other monster-catching games.

## Affinity List

The 6 affinities in this game are the following:

- water
- fire
- wind
- electric
- ice
- earth

## Affinity Groups

There are two groups (as shown below):

- water, fire, wind
- electric, ice, earth

Shadow creatures can have 1 or 2 affinities, each from a different group

- _This means that certain combinations are not possible, like fire/water, earth/electric, etc_

Groups work like classic rock-paper-scissors

- _water is strong against fire, fire against wind and wind against water, etc_

All affinities have a **complement**. **A complementary affinity** is the affinity that each affinity is strong against

- _Example: wind is the complementary affinity of fire_

## Attack Modifiers

When it comes to affinities, there are two multipliers to be aware of:

**SAM (same affinity multiplier)**

- if you attack with a creature that has the same type as the move you are performing, you receive a **1.5X multiplier**

**CAD(complimentary affinity divider)**

- if you attack with a creature that has a type that is complementary to the move you are performing, you receive a **0.75X multiplier**

For example, If you are attacking with a creature with <span className="has-water-affinity">water</span> affinity with a fire attack, this attack does 0.75 times as much damage as it would do normally

On the other hand, if a wind creature attacks with an electric attack, no modifier is applied.
