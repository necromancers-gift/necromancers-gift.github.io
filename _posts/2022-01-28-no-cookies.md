## Overview

I dislike cookie banners. A lot.
So I'm very glad to announce this website doesn't use cookies to track you to show you its contents.

You can opt-in for some 3rd-party cookies to display comments which are not easy to completely eliminate, but I think that's an acceptable compromise.

See you in the next monthly update!
