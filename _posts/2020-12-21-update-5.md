## Art Update

I previously showed the concept art for legendary creatures. This week I have an updated view for them. There is even an idle animation of the fire legendary!

<div style="width:100%;display:flex;justify-content:space-around;align-items:center">
<img src="/assets/images/updates/5/wind_legendary.png" alt="" style="width:31%;">
<img src="/assets/images/updates/5/fire_legendary.gif" alt="" style="width:31%;">
<img src="/assets/images/updates/5/water_legendary.png" alt="" style="width:31%;">
</div>
<br/>

I've also added some art assets for maps in the game. Thanks to these, unknown creatures, boss creatures and trainers can now be represented in maps. Take a look at one such map here:

<div style="width:100%;display:flex;justify-content:space-around;align-items:center">
<img src="/assets/images/updates/5/map_showcase.png" alt="" style="width:100%;">
</div>
<br/>

PS: If you want to generate very similar tech tree maps in a browser, I have conveniently made an [<u>open source library</u>](https://ldd.github.io/react-tech-tree/) that you can use right now. (Make sure to [<u>star it on github</u>](https://github.com/ldd/react-tech-tree#readme))

## Community Update

Name suggestions for legendaries will end soon. After that, like usual, polls will start and finalized names will be picked.
Since the conversation focused on legendaries, we even had a regular member(Sigon) post a meme edition of the water legendary

<div style="width:100%;display:flex;justify-content:space-around;align-items:center">
<img src="/assets/images/updates/5/meme_legendary.png" alt="" style="width:35%;">
</div>
<br/>

Of course that it was added as an emoji to the game. In fact, all creatures can now be used on discord as emojis.
There is even an informal poll there to pick your favourite. Make sure [<u>to join</u>](https://discord.gg/u64Mg4X) ;D
