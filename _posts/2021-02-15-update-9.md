## Community Update

Necrobot has been updated. As usual, hereâ€™s the informal changelog:

- features

  - better user onboarding (what happens when a new user joins)
    - generate a team for a new user after they pick an affinity
    - send a welcome message to the right affinity channel
  - more reactions grant experience
  - you can donate necrocoins to other users
  - you can spend necrocoins to rename the bot
  - prepare team storage subcommand
  - add and display shinies (none present besides Bisloba's Gigaquad for the moment)

- fixes
  - added missing name to our frog boi
  - leaderboard for experience command can be used by anyone, not just the server owner

## Kickstarter Update

I've started trying to promote the kickstarter wherever I could.
I first used twitter and then discord. Then I tried my luck on reddit.

It worked!

On r/pixelart, [<u>my post</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/leau6r/all_revealed_creatures_from_my_game_necromancers/) received 2725 upvotes, and a good amount of upvotes on [<u>r/MonsterTamerWorld</u>](https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterTamerWorld/comments/leas97/necromancers_gift_all_creatures_revealed_so_far/) too!

After the post when viral, the game's twitter followers and discord member count increased dramatically.

As of this post, here's a summary of the social media presence of the game:

| kickstarter followers || &nbsp;&nbsp;96 |
| twitter followers || 638 |
| discord members || 259 |
