## Art Update

Here is the animation for the fire starter evolution, which was missing from last month's starter evolution showcase:

## Community Update

### Starter names

Our _Wind Starter Candle_ backer, Lucas, revealed the names for the wind starter creatures:

> Sunli > Sunlitika > Litika

</div>

I personally love these names, and I've already added them to the bestiary. Don't worry, the other starters will get names eventually too.

## Game Update

### Backups

I like having a backup plan just in case things go awry. In terms of the codebase of the game, I make commits to a private repository that I have on github, but I keep a mirrored version on bitbucket.

This month I spent some time making sure I had a backup solution just in case I ever had problems with my backend provider, [<u>Google Cloud</u>](https://cloud.google.com/). I already kept [database backups on AWS S3](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2021/04/30/update-11.html#game-update), so I removed dependencies on some google services just in case I ever need to migrate to [<u>AWS</u>](https://aws.amazon.com/). 

This also ended up being the perfect time to create [<u>api.necromancers-gift.com</u>](https://api.necromancers-gift.com), which doesn't do anything too important. _For now_.

Random tidbit of information that I think I hadn't shared until now: during the Kickstarter, I had my Facebook ad account suspended for around 1 week. Facebook support was very nice, and even gave me a small credit once they fixed the issue, but I had established a backup plan, and it's possible you saw an ad for the game on [<u>Kicktraq</u>](https://www.kicktraq.com/) instead.

All that to say that I do try to be as prepared as possible for the little obstacles that show up in the development of the game.

### Road map

As a final note, I want to acknowledge that there haven't been any updates that I can show in terms of you know... actual gameplay. I am still diligently working on the game, but I sadly have nothing to show since this was yet another scaffolding month. 

I think things are going relatively alright, and the Kickstarter backers with alpha access should have access to the early alpha on **August 31st**, just as the original timeline posted on Kickstarter.

I want however to set expectations correctly, and confirm that I haven't prioritized polishing or bug fixing. This means that the alpha will serve as the start of a conversation, rather than a finished product, as most alphas are these days. It is also very possible that I have to delay the early access release, but that's a conversation we can have much later.
