## Art Update

The second round of naming contests has finished sucesfully. Here's a preview of all the creatures that got a name:

</div>

As usual, you can check their names in the [<u>bestiary</u>](/bestiary).

Marlon, our only moderator for now, also updated the [<u>google doc</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owgwk7gYKtzf42RBM0ebitIR8Be7x3t6Mo83UWfw5UY)
he shared with a summary of the winners and the names of all the creatures in the game. You can also download the [<u>PDF version</u>](/assets/naming_results1.pdf) if that's more convenient for you too.

#### Evolutions

One of the stretch goals of the Kickstarter was simply named "More Animations". Well, here is part of what I had in mind when I wrote it: evolution animations for all the starters!

</div>

The animation for the fire starter is obviously missing, but I hope you like them. There is a poem associated with each starter, and I think that the end result will look great. I'll also keep the last stage evolutions secret for now, but I do want to confirm that they exist.

## Community Update

Necrobot has been updated. Here's a quick overview of the most important changes:

- small bug fixes that probably only I noticed
- added a Shop Event where you can buy a small variety of items
- added the `$bag` command, which lets you equip items to your creatures

ps: Look forward to the new creatures appearing in Trivia Events soon ðŸ‘€. There are no big features coming soon for the bot, but battles are still planned to be added before the end of the year.

## Game Update

I finally had time to make a mac release for the game and add automatic scripts to help publish it. There is also an exit button, which was missing from the PC release too.
