## Overview

There have obviously been a ton of game updates since the last time I wrote anything here. Here's a quick summary of all of those.

- [<u>Music update</u>](#music-update)
- [<u>Feedback update</u>](#feedback-update)

## Art Update

As a result of the voting poll, I've revealed the initial roster of creatures for the game.
You can go to the <a href="/bestiary"><u>bestiary</u></a> to see them in action, but here's a quick preview:

I've also revealed the title screen for the game, which is a beautiful pixel art sunrise landscape:

</div>

And finally, I also revealed capturing boxes and their animation:

## Music Update

The game will have a very small set of songs, but I think they are great. Besides these two, there is one that hasn't been revealed yet. The best part about the songs is that they loop and that you can listen to them on repeat!

## Feedback Update

To fix bugs and address concearns by testers, I have added two public trello boards that you can check out by clicking on them:
