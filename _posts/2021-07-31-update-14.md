Shiny Contests for the second batch of creatures started, and we even got some winners already:

## Community Update

### Starter names

Our _Fire Starter Candle_ backer, Kohor, revealed the names for the fire starter creatures:

> Pu'u ahi > Ingeru Mura > O ka Popoki Dia

<div class="image-container">

</div>

Kohor went out of his way to pick names from languages we haven't seen yet. Only the water starter line is missing names now!

### Coverage

Gym Leader Ed had a poll for his youtube community and NG won with 61% of votes. It was obviously not a rigorous poll, but every little bit of coverage helps, right?

### Necrodex

This month I also made the necrodex public : [<u>https://necrodex.necromancers-gift.com/</u>](https://necrodex.necromancers-gift.com/)

It will probably be more useful in the future, as more details for each creature are revealed, but I thought this was an important step towards having all information available on every creature in the game.

</div>

### Necrobot

- Following the necrodex website announcement, necrobot received an update and a command called `$dex show` that can show you your progression on discord. And before you ask, of course there's a reward for completing your necrodex. I think nobody is even remotely close, so you have plenty of time to catch up.

- There was an event for _Capybara Appreciation Day_, where 3 capybeary creatures were given to 3 lucky members.

- The contest to pick the most liked designs from the creatures revealed so far ended. Luni and Eclix won without a sweat.

## Game Update

### Keybindings

As a rite of passage for every game developer out there, I finally had time to add keybindings for controller and keyboard layouts, as you can see here:

</div>
_I hope I get to revisit this screen soon, and update the barebones UI you see right now._

### Abilities

Speaking of UI, here's something that I won't explain. A feature teaser, if you want to call it that:
