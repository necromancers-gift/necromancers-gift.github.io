## Game Update

- <pre style="color: orange">version 0.5.6-playtest-alpha1</pre>

```asciidoc
features
==========

- add stats, movesets, affinities and names for batch 3 creatures (as well as enabling them)
- add terrain so that different creatures show in different levels (with some overlap)

fixes
==========

- in stats screen: fixed an issue where too many numbers showed up in the bottom axis
  when more than ~10 rooms had been visited. A maximum of 10 ticks are shown now.
- in title screen: fixed an issue where you couldn't exit the submenu with a controller
- in dex screen: fix small display issues for creatures with incomplete data
```

- <pre style="color: orange">version 0.5.7-playtest-alpha1</pre>

features
==========

- add a submenu in shop rooms to allow you to equip/unequip held items across all creatures in your team
- prepare for next week's update which will include proper item prices and coin rewards to allow players to buy items more effectively

fixes
==========

- change Windows version used to make builds to Windows Server 2019
  (github is changing the default to windows Server 2022 and I'm really not ready to migrate to it yet)
