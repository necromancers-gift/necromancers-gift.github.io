## Overview

This week we cover some art and gameplay updates and talk a little bit about what's going on in the community (on discord).

## Gameplay Updates

People want to see some footage from the game, so here's the first video for that:

<!-- battle arena showcase -->
 <div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N6Re4JnpBCU?controls=0"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<br/>

Before I go on to talk more about the _Battle Arena_, I wanted to show you a new feature that I just implemented last week.
The Team Builder:

<!-- team builder showcase -->
 <div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YHGBTO4XCn8?controls=0"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<br/>

As you can see from those videos, the _Battle Arena_ is a very quick menu to have battles against bots and other players.

For now, the battle arena includes the following modes (available now for `alpha-testers` to play with):

- battles against **bots** with:
  - random teams of 3 or 5 creatures each
  - <span style="color: gold">[new]</span> teams generated with the Team Builder
- battles against **players** with:
  - a random team of 5 creatures each

### Disabled Features & future plans

As you could see in that video, there is one feature that has been temporarily disabled:
The ability to creature bots and upload bots for others to play with.

Don't worry, I fully plan on making it available eventually, but I do not consider it to be a critical part of the features I want players to have as soon as possible.

A far more critical issue that I hadn't tackled yet is that the levelling formulas I use no longer reflect the numbers I was going for. On top of this, the movesets for creatures need to be heavily improved to be able to have interesting battles.

Next week my priority will shift towards those changes.

### Bonus

This is not too important, but you can take a look at the Settings Screen of the game:

<!-- settings showcase -->
 <div class="embed-container">
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1jeF43P4f9Q?controls=0"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
<br/>

Today, it barely has any options, but with the passing of time, I plan on adding options based on comminity feedback.
And yes, that absolutely includes rebindable keys and better controller support.

## Community Updates

### Shiny Art Contest

Shiny contests have continued as usual. I was particularly impressed by venito's line entries by Xievos and Marlon (through Bisloba):

_Marlon was inspired by [<u>corn snakes</u>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Kornnatter.jpg)_

And Jolly's entry for pisci's line:

### Discord Bot

I can finally also announce that I've been developing a discord bot.

_Get info from some of the creatures_

More info and planned features will be announced soon, so I hope you like what is available right now!

## Art Updates

Last but not least, we have dragons.

More specifically, the wind legendary has been released along new concept art for more creatures.
