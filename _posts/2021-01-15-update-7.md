## Art Update

A revised necromancer is finally here. You can see that its eye matches one of the three primary affinities. This is not a coincidence.
Speaking of assets that haven't been talked about lately, there is a new look for the first floor leader that you can see now.

There is even a gif with her in-game team. It shouldn't come as a surprise to those that have played the prototype, but it's always nice to see them all together.

## Community Update

The poll for the water affinity legendaries ended. The community voted on discord and twitter and the respective names for the legendary line are as follows:

Axofloatl and Rynami

Those that voted received 5 necrocoins, which is a currency I introduced a couple of weeks ago on discord. Don't worry, this is more for fun and match currency in the game, and in no way would it mean microtransactions or pay-to-win mechanics.

On that note, necrobot has been updated. Here's the informal changelog:

- features

  - leaderboard for top balances
  - list all available items and creatures with $info items list and $info creatures list
  - give suggestions if item/creatures is not found when using $info items and $info creatures

- fixes
  - fix not being able to list info on starters ($info creatures wind_starter_A works now, for example)
  - increased the timeout for the trivia events (from 20 minutes to several hours)

Make sure to join the discord to create a team and see as this bots gains more and more features.

## Gameplay Update

Version `v0.3.6-prototype.0` of the prototype is coming out this <strike>Sunday</strike> Monday with changes to moves.

<div class="image-container">
<img src="/assets/images/updates/7/move-targets-priority.png" alt="" style="width:100%;">
</div>

Here's the changelog:

- features

  - add and use already available targets (all, allies, party, foe party, leaders, etc)
  - add a good chunk of move/target combinations (poisoning the entire other side, etc)
  - add moves that recover your MP/HP by inflicting you with a series of effects
  - simplify move labels
  - add per-status duration (so that sleep can have a different duration than poison, etc)
  - add creature turn, and condition based on turns
  - display who goes first next turn in a battle (with a cute little arrow)

- fixes
  - change cost of some moves (make bite less OP)
  - change formula for mp stat (less MP at higher levels)
  - nerf sleep (from 6 turns to 3 turns)
  - improve how moves that cannot be shown are hidden
  - fix: do not perform percentage-based moves when MP is 0
  - fix font issues that made the game technically require an online connection to be played
  - fix crash when an event dealt with an empty party
  - fix ugly bug introduced in last version where checking for supereffective moves crashed the game
  - fix bug where using an item did not trigger status effects
